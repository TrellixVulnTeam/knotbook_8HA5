/**
 * Pure implementation of VirtualFlow that is independent of cells
 * or scroll bars; those can be handled in another class
 *
 * [LinearVirtualFlow] represents the view in 1D. 2 instances of this
 * class can be used to construct a virtual flow mechanism for an
 * actual table/grid
 *
 * The class also includes some fine tuned calculations for
 * JavaFX layout.
 *
 * Usage of this class requires calling the right methods after
 * changing parameters, because it's too complex to listen for changes.
